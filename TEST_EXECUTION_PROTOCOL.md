# 🧪 **Neo4j v1.1.0 Testing Protocol**

## **🎯 Test Environment Status**
- ✅ **n8n**: Running on http://localhost:5678
- ✅ **Neo4j**: Running on http://localhost:7474 (neo4j/password123)
- ✅ **Vector Index**: `vector_index` - ONLINE (2560 dimensions, COSINE)
- ✅ **Code**: v1.1.0 compiled and deployed

---

## **📋 Test Suite Execution**

### **Test 1: Basic Operations Availability**
**Objective**: Verify new operations appear in n8n UI

**Steps**:
1. Open n8n at http://localhost:5678
2. Create new workflow
3. Add Neo4j node
4. Check Manual Mode → Vector Store operations
5. Check AI Tool Mode operations

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Process Document appears in Vector Store operations
- ✅ Hybrid Search appears in Vector Store operations  
- ✅ Clean by Metadata appears in Vector Store operations
- ✅ Update Document appears in Vector Store operations
- ✅ Document Processor appears in AI Tool operations
- ✅ Smart Search appears in AI Tool operations
- ✅ Graph Builder appears in AI Tool operations

---

### **Test 2: Process Document Operation**
**Objective**: Test AI-powered document processing functionality

**Test Data**:
```json
{
  "mode": "manual",
  "resource": "vectorStore",
  "operation": "processDocument",
  "documentContent": "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are transformative technologies. Neo4j is a powerful graph database that enables complex relationship queries. Vector search capabilities allow semantic similarity matching.",
  "documentTitle": "AI and Neo4j Integration Test",
  "extractEntities": true,
  "createRelationships": true
}
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Document chunked into manageable pieces
- ✅ Chunks added to vector store with metadata
- ✅ Document node created in graph database
- ✅ Success response with processing statistics
- ✅ No errors or exceptions thrown

**Neo4j Verification**:
```cypher
MATCH (d:Document) WHERE d.title CONTAINS "AI and Neo4j" RETURN d;
```

---

### **Test 3: Hybrid Search Operation**  
**Objective**: Test combined vector + graph search

**Test Data**:
```json
{
  "mode": "manual",
  "resource": "vectorStore", 
  "operation": "hybridSearch",
  "hybridQuery": "artificial intelligence machine learning",
  "searchContext": "technical concepts and relationships"
}
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Search strategy intelligently selected
- ✅ Vector search results included
- ✅ Graph search results included (if applicable)
- ✅ Results properly ranked and combined
- ✅ Source attribution (vector vs graph) included

---

### **Test 4: Clean by Metadata Operation**
**Objective**: Test metadata-based cleanup functionality

**Test Data**:
```json
{
  "mode": "manual",
  "resource": "vectorStore",
  "operation": "cleanByMetadata", 
  "metadataCriteria": {
    "type": "document_chunk",
    "title": "AI and Neo4j Integration Test"
  }
}
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Matching documents identified
- ✅ Documents removed from vector store
- ✅ Associated graph nodes removed
- ✅ Deletion count reported correctly
- ✅ No orphaned data left behind

---

### **Test 5: Update Document Operation**
**Objective**: Test document versioning and update functionality

**Setup**: First create a document with known ID
**Test Data**:
```json
{
  "mode": "manual",
  "resource": "vectorStore",
  "operation": "updateDocument",
  "documentId": "test-doc-update-1", 
  "newContent": "Updated content about AI, ML, and graph databases with new insights about vector similarity search.",
  "checkMD5": true
}
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Document existence verified
- ✅ MD5 hash calculated and compared
- ✅ Content updated if changes detected
- ✅ Metadata timestamps updated
- ✅ Proper response with update status

---

## **🤖 AI Tool Integration Tests**

### **Test 6: AI Agent Tool Discovery**
**Objective**: Verify AI Agent can discover and use new tools

**Steps**:
1. Create AI Agent workflow
2. Connect Neo4j node as tool to AI Agent
3. Set mode to "AI Tool" 
4. Configure tool operation to new operations
5. Test AI Agent tool discovery

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ New tools appear in AI Agent's tool list
- ✅ Tool descriptions are clear and helpful
- ✅ Parameters are properly exposed to AI Agent
- ✅ AI Agent can invoke tools successfully

---

## **⚡ Performance & Reliability Tests**

### **Test 7: Large Document Processing**
**Test Data**: 5000+ character document
**Expected**: Processes within reasonable time (<30s)

### **Test 8: Concurrent Operations**  
**Test Data**: Multiple operations simultaneously
**Expected**: No race conditions or data corruption

### **Test 9: Error Handling**
**Test Data**: Invalid parameters and edge cases
**Expected**: Graceful error handling with meaningful messages

---

## **🔄 Backward Compatibility Tests**

### **Test 10: Existing Operations**
**Objective**: Ensure all v1.0.x operations still work

**Test Cases**:
- ✅ Similarity Search works unchanged
- ✅ Add Texts works unchanged  
- ✅ Add Documents works unchanged
- ✅ Execute Query works unchanged
- ✅ Create Node works unchanged
- ✅ Create Relationship works unchanged
- ✅ Get Schema works unchanged
